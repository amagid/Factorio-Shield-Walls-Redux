# Shielded Walls Redux

A rebuild of SonsakuX's High Resistance Regenerating Walls ("Shielded Walls") mod for Factorio. I really liked their mod, but unfortunately it used to cause the game to stutter. I rebuilt the mod to fix the performance issues. Aside from that, the mod has not changed.

This mod adds some expensive, quickly regenerating walls and gates to the game. Ideal for mid- to late-game bases in need of heavy defenses.

The first tier, Shielded Walls/Gates, regenerate very quickly and have high damage resistance.
The second tier, Repulsor Walls/Gates, regenerate very quickly, have higher damage resistance and deal instant damage to their attacker.
